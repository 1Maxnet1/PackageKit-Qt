Version 0.8.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2012-11-26

Notes:
 - This is the first release of Packagekit-Qt which has been split out
   of the main PackageKit project.
 - This project is decoupled from the main PackageKit project from this
   point onwards and does not subscribe to the same API and ABI promises
   of PackageKit. That said, it's no co-incidence that this tarball
   release happened on the same day as the PackageKit release :)

 - Added release instructions and simple release-script (Matthias Klumpp)
 - Added versioning, Qt4 support and installed basic files (Matthias Klumpp)
 - Created basic project and CMake skeleton (Matthias Klumpp)

Bugfixes:
 - Add bitfield.h to the files to install (Daniel Nicoletti)
 - Always make sure DBus interface specs are present (Matthias Klumpp)
 - Fix QPK API level (Matthias Klumpp)
